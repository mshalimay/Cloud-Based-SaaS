# GAS Framework
An enhanced web framework (based on [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)) for use in the capstone project. Adds robust user authentication (via [Globus Auth](https://docs.globus.org/api/auth)), modular templates, and some simple styling based on [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/).

This project was developed as part of UChicago MPCS Cloud Computing course created by Professor Vas Vasiliadis.

Directory contents are as follows:
* `/web` - The GAS web app filesq
* `/ann` - Annotator files
* `/util` - Utility scripts/apps for notifications, archival, and restoration
* `/aws` - AWS user data files
